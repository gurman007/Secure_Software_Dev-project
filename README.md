# An Investigation into Feature Generation for ML-Guided Symbolic Execution

This repository contains the full research project and associated scripts for the paper/presentation titled, "An Investigation into Feature Generation for ML-Guided Symbolic Execution."

## Project Overview

This project began with the goal of enhancing the KLEE symbolic execution engine by using a machine learning model to predict and prioritize bug-prone functions. However, the research evolved into a critical investigation of the prerequisites and common pitfalls in using symbolic execution as a data source for machine learning.

Our key finding is that a standard, "out-of-the-box" configuration of KLEE fails to generate meaningful dynamic features for C programs that use standard libraries. This is due to KLEE's inability to handle external function calls without proper modeling.

We quantitatively proved the impact of this data quality issue by training a Decision Tree classifier on the flawed data, which achieved a near-random accuracy of **59.57%**. This result serves as conclusive evidence that the features generated by the misconfigured KLEE run contain no predictive signal.

The primary contribution of this work is the formal diagnosis of this pitfall and a clear guideline for future researchers: **data quality validation and correct tool configuration are mandatory first steps.**
